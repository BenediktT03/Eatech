#### Decision
Implement a multi-layer caching strategy using Redis for application caching and Firestore's built-in caching.

#### Implementation
```javascript
// Multi-Layer Caching Strategy
const CachingStrategy = {
  layers: {
    l1_browser: {
      storage: 'Browser memory + IndexedDB',
      duration: '5-30 minutes',
      data: ['Menu items', 'User preferences', 'App state']
    },
    
    l2_cdn: {
      storage: 'Cloudflare Edge Cache',
      duration: '1-24 hours',
      data: ['Static assets', 'Public API responses']
    },
    
    l3_application: {
      storage: 'Redis (Upstash)',
      duration: '5 minutes - 24 hours',
      data: ['Sessions', 'Tenant configs', 'Hot data']
    },
    
    l4_database: {
      storage: 'Firestore client cache',
      duration: '1 hour',
      data: ['Query results', 'Document snapshots']
    }
  },
  
  patterns: {
    cacheAside: 'Manual cache management',
    writeThrough: 'Critical data consistency',
    writeBack: 'High-write scenarios',
    refreshAhead: 'Predictable access patterns'
  },
  
  invalidation: {
    timeToLive: 'Automatic expiration',
    eventBased: 'Cache invalidation on data changes',
